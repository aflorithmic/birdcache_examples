I should have known
I would leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I would fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you will never see me cry
There is just no time to die
I let it burn
You are no longer my concern
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
